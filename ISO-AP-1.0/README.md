#Conformance Class: ISO AP 1.0

Standardization target: XML document (MD_Metadata, schema: http://schemas.opengis.net/csw/2.0.2/profiles/apiso/1.0.0/apiso.xsd)

Note: The TG distinguishes between validating against ISO AP 1.0 and against ISO/DTS 19139. However, as both use the same ISO/DTS 19139 schema Ithey are combined into one CC.
