Interoperable Spatial Data Services v3.1
========================================

Conformance Class for "Interoperable Spatial Data Services"
as defined in the Technical Guidance for INSPIRE Spatial Data Services and services allowing spatial data services to be invoked.

*Note*: This CC is in ready-for-review stage, none of the tests have an official INSPIRE MIG approval.

## Tests

The CC for the "TG Conformance Class 2:Spatial data services compliant with interoperability arrangements"
includes all the tests in the [CC Invocable SDS](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/ats/spatial-data-services/3.1/Invocable-Spatial-Data-Services), and additionally
the following tests:

| Identifier                                                        | Status   |

## Tests (MIWP-8 alternative)

The CC for the "TG Conformance Class 2:Spatial data services compliant with interoperability arrangements"
according to the alternative option for the QoS reporting proposed by MIWP-8, includes all the tests
in the [CC Invocable SDS](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/ats/spatial-data-services/3.1/Invocable-Spatial-Data-Services), and additionally
the following tests:

| Identifier                                                        | Status   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [Supported crses as list](supported-crses-as-list.md) | ready for review |
| [DQ ConceptualConsistency for QoS declared availability](dq-conceptualconsistency-for-qos-declared-availability.md) | ready for review |

## Open issues
* The extension to the ISO 19119 metadata class ```SV_ServiceIdentification``` is defined twice in [TG SDS](#ref_TG_SDS): in Annex A just the ```category``` as a mandatory property is added, and in Annex C just the ```qualityOfService``` mandatory property is added. This means that the neither of these extended classes can be used to fulfill both the requirements IR 1 and IR 8, IR 9 or IR 10 at the same time.
* The XML Schema for the inspire_sds_gmd has not been published yet, so the XML Schema validation is not possible.

## XML namespace prefixes <a name="namespaces"></a>

The following prefixes are used to refer to the corresponding XML namespaces in all test descriptions:
